# NoteBot_Whisper
The goal of our project is to develop a Discord bot capable of transcribing, translating and summarizing conversations in real time within Discord voice channels. The bot will transcribe spoken audio and translate it into English, incorporating support for Swiss German, which is not commonly available in most transcription systems. 

## TODOs
1. Set up your dev environment
```bash
conda create --name "aicomp" python=3.11.9
conda activate aicomp
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Create the `.env` file. You have an example here `example.env` and place your required usernames and keys in it.

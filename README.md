# NoteBot_Whisper
The goal of our project is to develop a Discord bot capable of transcribing, translating and summarizing conversations in real time within Discord voice channels. The bot will transcribe spoken audio and translate it into English, incorporating support for Swiss German, which is not commonly available in most transcription systems. 

## Setup the environment
### 1
conda create --name "notebot" python=3.11.9
conda activate notebot
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 2
